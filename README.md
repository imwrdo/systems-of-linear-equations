# Systems of linear equations

## Project Description

The project focuses on the implementation and analysis of two iterative methods, Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel, and one direct method, LU factorization, for solving systems of linear equations. The motivation for conducting research on these methods is their widespread use in various fields of science and technology, where one often encounters the need to solve systems of equations resulting from the discretization of differential equations.

## Technologies

The project was implemented using Python and the following libraries:

- `pandas` for loading stock data from a CSV file,
- `matplotlib` for visualizing results by drawing charts.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imwrdo/systems-of-linear-equations.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas | pip install matplotlib
```
